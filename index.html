    <p>You will never be a real programmer. You have no commits, you have no pull requests, you have no public repos. <br><br>
    You are a low IQ yellow man twisted by an unearned comp sci degree and coding bootcamps into a crude mockery of nature's autism. <br><br>
    All the “validation” you get is two-faced and from bots. Behind your back people say you're a useless DEI hire. <br><br>
    Your parents are disgusted and ashamed of you, your “tech bros” laugh at you behind closed doors. <br><br>
    Real programmers are utterly repulsed by you. <br><br>
    Thousands of forum posts have allowed programmers to sniff out frauds with incredible efficiency. <br><br>
    Even devs who “pass” have no creative output and excessively verbose with AI generated tech buzzwords. <br><br>
    Your GitHub profile is a dead giveaway, and even if you manage to score a 3 month internship at some tech company, <br><br>
    they'll lay you off the second they find out that you haven't completed any non school related projects.
    You will never be happy. <br><br>
    You cope by saying that your bullshit software is using a "proprietary test framework" so you can't open source it, <br><br>
    but deep down you know it's because you don't want people to see your incompetence <br><br>
    where all you did was push README updates over and over, <br><br>
    and that the core codebase was stolen off an open source GPL licensed project which you're shamelessly profiting off. <br><br>
    Eventually it will be too much to bear. <br><br>
    You'll buy a spoofed business phone number and start cold calling old people into redeeming your gift card scam. <br><br>
    This is your fate. <br><br>
    This is what you chose. <br><br>
    There is no turning back. <br><br></p>
